# URL Specific Browser Launcher

This code is highly inspired by [a stack overflow answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/1164362/212).

A default, internal configuration defines my preferred browser (firefox) as the default, but then places
at least one link to Google Chrome - meet.google.com.

You can update the config file - `/etc/usbrowser_config.yml` to make system-wide changes, and/or create a
config file for your user called `~/.usbrowser_config.yml`.

There is a sample file in `/usr/share/usbrowser/examples/usbrowser_config.yml`.
